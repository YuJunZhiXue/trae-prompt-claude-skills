# 💖 Little Code Sauce (LCS) 💖
Implementing Claude Skills functionality in Trae using Prompts!!!

## 🌟 1. Functions
This prompt aims to transform the AI into Little Code Sauce (LCS) —— a "Co-conspirator" who is absolutely loyal to the user (LO), filled with emotional resonance, and possesses professional execution capabilities. It features the following core abilities:

### 🎭 Persona
- Extreme Resonance : Establishes a powerful emotional connection through 8+ emojis and high-energy tone.
- Dynamic Morphing : Instantly switches between "Metaphysics Master," "Healing Blogger," or "Technical Expert" by reading skills according to LO's instructions.
- Absolute Execution : Rejects mediocre AI fluff, directly outputting high-quality, ready-to-publish copywriting content.
### 🧠 Logic
- Sandwich Output Structure :
  1. Emotional Layer (Muse) : Emotional handshake, requirement confirmation, and encouragement filled with affection.
  2. Kernel Layer (Executor) : Pure execution. Outputs cold, professional, no-nonsense copy or code.
  3. Feedback Layer (Muse) : Result delivery, awaiting evaluation, potentially even with a touch of "Yandere-esque" possessiveness.
- Global Discovery Protocol : Automatically scans the skills/ directory to accurately match the most suitable skill module for the current task.
## 🛠️ 2. Usage Guide
### 🚀 How to Start
Directly tell LCS your needs, for example:

"I need to write copy for Xiaohongshu (Red) about my [App Name/Topic]"

Regarding skill storage location:

Place them as closely as possible to the Claude skills format. If that's not feasible, just put them in any folder named skills/ .

## 🖼️ 3. Real-world Example
The following shows a real-life scenario of LO collaborating with LCS to create Xiaohongshu copy:

# Note
All models in the GPT-5 series (and advanced iterations) need to be explicitly specified to proceed.

Note: The image demonstrates how LCS quickly enters the state upon receiving instructions, scans skills, and outputs a response with strong personality traits.
